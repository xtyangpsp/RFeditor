.SH DESCRIPTION
There may be occasions where you have waveforms and need predicted arrivals
but do not wish to run the data through the \fBdbdetect(1)\fP and 
\fBdbgrassoc(1)\fP processes.  This script generates an arrival table in 
the \fIdbout\fP database populated with predicted arrivals when given: an 
input catalog, \fIdbcat\fP and an input site (and optionally deployment) 
database, \fIdbcat\fP.

The script is fairly dumb and performs only minimal checking to see if the
station in the site table was "on" during the event of interest.

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.IP -v
Verbose messaging.
.IP -n
Only report how many arrivals would be added.  Do not actually generate 
an arrival table.
.IP -d 
Use the deployment table available in the \fIdbsite\fP database.  This 
forces a subset in attempt to only produce arrivals for stations that may have
been operational during the time of the events of interest.  The deployment 
table must be accessible through the \fIdbsite\fP descriptor.
.IP "-a site_subset"
Subset the site table with the expression specified for \fIsite_subset\fP.  The
subset expression must be valid for the site table.
.IP "-c chan"
Change the default channel for placing P picks.  The default channel is BHZ.  
All P picks are placed on this channel.
.IP "-s origin_subset"
Subset the origin table of the input catalog \fIdbcat\fP.  Only produce 
predicted arrivals for the origins that meet these subset rules.
.IP dbcat
Database which contains the origins from which predicted arrivals are 
calculated.
.IP dbsite
Database which contains the site table.  Picks are generated for all stations 
which have active ondate/offdate spans for the time of the origins of interest
unless the \fI-a site_subset\fP reduces the list.
.IP dbout
Output database that contains the generated arrival table with the 
predicted P picks.  Note: this script does not test the database for 
pre-existing arrivals.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Needs to be run under an ANTELOPE environment.
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Generate predicted P arrivals for the A*, B*, C*, and D* stations found in the
site database, my_experiment, for orid 13781 from the qed bulletin and save
the arrivals to the test database.
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
 %\fB get_predicted_Parrivals -s "orid=='13781'" \\
    -a "sta=~/[ABCD].*/" qed my_experiment test \fP
.fi
.ft R
.in

.LP
Show how many arrivals would be added for each event in the big_quakes 
database.  No arrivals will be generated.
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
 %\fB get_predicted_Parrivals -n big_quakes my_experiment test \fP
.fi
.ft R
.in

.LP
Generate predicted P arrivals using channel HHZ, for stations that are
operational according to the deployment table of my_exeperiment.  Only
use origins with magnitudes greater than 7.0 or depths greater than 500.
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
 %\fB get_predicted_Parrivals -d -c HHZ \\
    -s "(mb>='7.0'||ms>='7.0')||depth>='500'" \\
    big_quakes my_experiment test \fP

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
You may not actually have waveforms for all stations where output arrivals
are generated (note that no wfdisc is needed for this script).
.LP
The output arrivals are likely not in the same database as your wfdisc.  You
will have to either rename the \fIdbout\fP.arrival, or modify a descriptor
file to point to these separate arrivals and your wfdisc.
.LP
You should still run \fBdbloc2(1)\fP or some other program such as 
\fBdbassoc_arrival\fP to associate these predicted arrivals to 
generate assoc, origin, origerr, and event rows. 
.LP
This script only puts in the predicted first arriving P arrival.  It uses the 
\fBptime\fP function from \fBdbexpressions\fP(5).
.LP
These are only predicted P arrivals based on the IASPEI travel time model.  
They should be analyst reviewed. 
.LP
There is no smart programming to check that you have waveform data for the
channel where the pick is to be applied.
.LP
Not extensively tested and little support will be provided.  This was a quick 
script that I thought might be useful.  If you want to modify it, please do 
so, and check in the changes to the contrib repository.
