Attribute pwfid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "wfid > 0" )
	Description ( "processed waveform id" )
	Detail {
		Comparable to wfid used in wfdisc, but this integer
		key is the primary index of the core processing waveform
		table and is used for association and joining of 
		ancillary tables created by all processing algorithms
		that use this schema.
	}

	Fields  ( sta chan pwfid lddate )
	Primary ( pwfid )
	Description ( "Link between wfprocess and css sta:chan concept" )
	Detail {
		The CSS3.0 schema is centered on the concept of using 
		station, channel, and a time interval as the primary index
		into seismic data.  This is what makes it possible for  CSS3.0 
		to provide a seamless view into both triggered and continuous data.  
		Not all seismic data, however, share this concept.  Multichannel
		data, or instance, would view a station name as an odd idea. 
		CSS3.0 is also dogmatic in it's perspective that all data are stored
		as scalar times series.  It and does not provide a simple way to 
		handle three-component data because of this viewpoint. 
		This tiny table provides a link between the CSS3.0 world 
		and a more abstract definition of seismic data through the wfprocess
		table.   The wfprocess table is data neutral containing only the
		most generic information required to describe time series data
		of any form.
