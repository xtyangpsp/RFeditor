Attribute averamp
	Real (8)
	Format ( "%8.6f" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Description ( "average amplitude in the waveform" )
	Detail {
		This attribute gives the average amplitude of deconvolution result.
	}
	;

Attribute epsilon
	Real (8)
	Format ( "%8.4f" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Description ( "residual ratio at final iteration" )
	Detail {
		This attribute gives epsilon value at the final iteration, which is the residual ration in the iterative deconvolution.
	}
	;

Attribute niteration
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Description ( "number of iteration" )
	Detail {
		This field is the number of iteration in the deconvolution.
	}
	;

Attribute nspike
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Description ( "number of spikes" )
	Detail {
		This field is the number of spikes in the each waveform.
	}
	;

Attribute peakamp
	Real (8)
	Format ( "%8.6f" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Description ( "peak amplitude in the waveform" )
	Detail {
		This attribute gives the peak amplitude of deconvolution result.
	}
	;

Attribute pwfid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "wfid > 0" )
	Description ( "processed waveform id" )
	Detail {
		Comparable to wfid used in wfdisc, but this integer
		key is the primary index of the core processing waveform
		table and is used for association and joining of 
		ancillary tables created by all processing algorithms
		that use this schema.
	}
	;

Attribute rawsnr
	Real (8)
	Format ( "%8.1f" )
	Null ( "-1.00" )
	Description ( "RMS signal-to-noise ratio of the raw data" )
	Detail {
		This attribute stores the signal-to-noise ratio (RMS) of the corresponding raw data.
	}
	;
