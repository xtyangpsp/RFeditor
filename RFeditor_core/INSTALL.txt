1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Download
	The package is available at: https://github.com/xtyangpsp/RFeditor. Assumming you have downloaded the package and saved it to: /Users/myhome/SOFT/src/RFeditor, this path is referred to as RFEROOT in this user guide. Under this directory, there are four subfolders:
(1) libtreditoperator
This directory contains the lib needed by RFeditor editing procedures. However, the library files are currently embedded in RFeditor core codes. Thus, compiling RFeditor does not require the compiling of this library. This library can be used by other utilities or extensional programs.
(2) RFeditor_core	This folder contains the RFeditor core source code.		
(3) Utilities	This folder includes the utilities related to the use of RFeditor.
(4) Docs	This folder contains this user guide and other related materials.
1.2 Citation

1.3 Support
	Support is provided through GitHub platform. You can create an issue or ask questions at: https://github.com/xtyangpsp/RFeditor. Or you can send emails regarding questions to: xtyang@indiana.edu.
2. INSTALLATION
	This program operates based on an Antelope Datascope database (version 5.5 and later). Go to: http://www.antelopeusersgroup.org to install contrib following the procedures there, if it is not installed along with the Antelope package. Please make sure that Antelope is working properly before installing this program. If you downloaded and installed the contrib package through git repository, you can update it, under your $ANTELOPE/contrib, by typing in terminal:
	$ git pull
	This will update your contrib package. After it finishes, recompile the updated programs. In Antelope 5.7, the contrib package is automatically downloaded into /opt/antelope/src. Compile it by:
	$ make clean
	$ make Include
	$ make install
	
2.1 Operation Systems
	This program has been fully tested under Mac OSX Mountain Lion (10.8), Mavericks (10.9), Yosemite (10.10), Sierra (10.12). Newer Mac OS should be fine but without heavy tests. For other linux-based systems, it should be working but please report any issues at: https://github.com/xtyangpsp/RFeditor.
2.2 Library dependency
	The following libraries are required in order to compile RFeditor (current version 3.x). You may need to install these libraries by the order as shown here:
(1) boost (http://www.boost.org):
	This is a C++ library. On Mac OSX, you can install it from fink. From our experience, please install the version tagged as “nophython”.
	$fink list boost
	$fink install boostpackagename
(2) xmotif: xwindow libraries;
	On Mac OSX, you can install motif from fink. In terminal, type: 
	$fink list motif
	Then, type: 
	$fink install motifpackagename
	Or, you can compile the source code by yourself. This package/source code could be downloaded from: http://motif.ics.com and the link there.

<<< Configure Antelope localmake >>
	After successfully installed boost and xmotif libraries, you have to enable boost and xmotif for Antelope. This can be done by running in any terminal: 
	$localmake_config
	This will lead you to the interface where you can enable BOOST and XMOTIF capabilities. You will need to type the paths for LIB and INCLUDE for both BOOST and XMOTIF libraries and then: “File->Save and Quit” to save these configurations.
(3) libgclgrid ($ANTELOPE/src/lib/utility/libgclgrid):
	This library should be installed automatically if you successfully compiled and installed the contrib package under $ANTELOPE/src. If not, cd to this directory and type:
	$make Include
	$make
(4) libseispp ($ANTELOPE/src/lib/seismic/libseispp)
	This library is released along with the Antelope contrib package. Once you successfully compiled contrib software, libseispp should be already available. If not, cd to this directory and type:
	$make Include
	$make
(5) libseisw ($ANTELOPE/src/lib/graphics/seisw): 
	Seismic widget library for plotting seismic traces as wiggles. It is part of the Antelope contrib package. Once you successfully compiled contrib software, libseisw should be already available. If not, cd to this directory and type:
	$make Include
	$make
2.3 Install RFeditor
	Once you have all of the required libraries installed and properly configured, cd to $RFEROOT and type in command line: 
	$make
	If the above compiling procedure is successful, run:
	$make install
	This deposit tredit and decon tables to $ANTELOPE/contrib/data/css3.0.ext/, deposit RFeditor executable to $ANTELOPE/contrib/bin, and deposity RFeditor.pf to $ANTELOPE/contrib/data/pf/. Please make sure you have the permission to write, read, and execute programs!
	If you the above compiling went through, congratulations, RFeditor is available to you.

<<< Trouble Shooting >>
	If you get errors complaining that some libraries are not found, you may need to find the library and copy it (or create a symbolic link) to: $ANTELOPE/lib. For example, lseispp means library file libseispp.a.
