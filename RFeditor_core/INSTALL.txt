<<Operation Systems>>
This program is fully tested under Mac OSX MontainLion (10.8), Mavericks (10.9), and Yosemite (10.10). 

For other linux-based systems, it should be working but please report any issues at: https://github.com/xtyangpsp/RFeditor.

****************************************
<<LIBRARY DEPENDENCY>>

This program operates on an Antelope Datascope database (version 5.5 and later). Please make sure that Antelope is working properly before installing this program. Go to: http://www.antelopeusersgroup.org to install contrib following the procedures there, if it is not installed along with the Antelope package. 

Update contrib:
Under your $ANTELOPE/contrib, type in terminal: git pull. This will update your contrib package. After it finishes, recompile the updated programs.

The following libraries are required in order to compile RFeditor (current version 3.0):
1. libseisw: 
Seismic widget library for plotting seismic traces as wiggles. It is part of the Antelope contrib package. 

2. boost (http://www.boost.org):
This is a C++ library. On Mac OSX, you can install it from fink.
$ fink list boost
$ fink install boostpackagename

3. xmotif: xwindow functions;
Mac OSX: on Mac OSX, you can install motif from fink.
In terminal, type: $ fink list motif
Then, type: $ fink install motifpackagename

Or, you can compile the source code by yourself. This package/source code could be downloaded from: http://motif.ics.com and the link there.

4. libseispp:
This library is released along with the Antelope contrib package. Once you successfully compiled contrib software, libseispp should be already available.


After successfully installed boost and xmotif libraries, run in terminal: 
$ localmake_config
This leads you to the interface where you can enable BOOST and XMOTIF capabilities.

****************************************
<<INSTALL>>
In terminal, type: 
$ make

If the above compiling procedure is successful, run:
$ make install
This deposit tredit and decon tables to $ANTELOPE/contrib/data/css3.0.ext/, deposit RFeditor executable to $ANTELOPE/contrib/bin, and deposity RFeditor.pf to $ANTELOPE/contrib/data/pf/.

**Make sure you have the permission to write, read, and execute programs.

If you the above compiling went through, congratulations, RFeditor is available to you.
